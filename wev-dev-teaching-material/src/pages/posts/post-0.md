# Introduction

My name is Neoh Wei Jun, and I will be teaching you the fundamentals of web development. Feel free to ask any questions and correct me if I am wrong, as I am also learning from you. If I don't know the answer, we will find out together.

I also plan on quickly go through the TalentLabs assignment once everyone completed it and share my thoughts on it. E.g., assignment 1 structure, code quality, etc. If you have a problem with the assignment, you can also ask me for help.

## Prerequisites

- There is no prerequisite for this class. I will teach you the fundamentals of web development. However, it is recommended that explore further on your own after the class.

## What can you expect to learn from this class

1. **Terminal**: I will teach you how to use the terminal to navigate your computer and run commands.

2. **VS Code (Productivity and Resources)**: I will teach you how to use VS Code to write code and optimise your productivity.

3. **HTML**: I will teach you how to use HTML to structure your website.

4. **CSS**: I will teach you how to use CSS to style your website.

5. **JavaScript**: I will teach you how to use JavaScript to make your website interactive.

6. **React**: I will teach you how to use React to build your website.

7. **Git and GitHub (Not sure yet)**: I will also teach you how to use Git and GitHub to manage your code.

## Concerns

Time is limited, and I am not sure if I can cover everything in the class. I will try my best to cover as much as possible. Priotise your **TalentLabs's assignment** first, if we have more time, I will teach more.
